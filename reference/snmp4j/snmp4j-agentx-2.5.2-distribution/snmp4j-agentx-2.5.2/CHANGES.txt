CHANGE LOG OF SNMP4J-AgentX
===========================

[2016-09-12] v2.5.2
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.5.3 SNMP4J v2.5.2 or later)

* Fixed [SFJ-129]: AgentXMaster GET BULK processing fails with general variable binding
  error when running a GETBULK request on a sequence of registered scalars/single object nodes
  that is as long (or longer) than max repetitions of the request and non-repeaters is greater
  than one (AgentXPendingGet.java). SNMP4J-Agent 2.5.2 is need to fix a similar bug in
  (SnmpRequest.java). The computation of the repetitions vb start index was
  incorrect when a request is reprocessed (which happens with AgentX and single instance (scalar)
  registrations quite often).
  Timeout occurs when sending a GETBULK with non-repeaters
  but zero max-repetitions and on-zero number of repetition sub-request OIDs
  (e.g. 3 VBs and max-repetitions 0 and 2 non-repeaters).

[2016-09-02] v2.5.1
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.5.0 SNMP4J v2.5.0 or later)

* Fixed [SFJ-128]: SNMP Get Bulk fails with a genErr when SNMP4J-AgentX master agent
  processes a GETBULK request that does not contain any repeaters (i.e. it could be
  replaced by a GETNEXT) (AgentXQueue.java).

[2016-06-12] v2.5.0
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.5.0 SNMP4J v2.5.0 or later)

* Fixed: Added missing factory method in DummyBufferedMOMutableTableModel.
* Added [SFJ-120]: Maven Central deployment support (refactored pom.xml).
* Fixed: Removed a few unnecessary casts/improved generic usage.

[2015-06-02] v2.2.2
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.3.3 SNMP4J v2.3.3 or later)
* Fixed [SFJ-106]: AgentXProtocol did not decode/encode the length of OIDs with 128 or
  more sub-identifiers correctly. Now the number of sub-identifiers is limited to 128
  as required by RFC2741 ยง5.1.

[2015-05-26] v2.2.1
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.3.3 SNMP4J v2.3.0 or later)
* Fixed [SFJ-104]: Infinite loop in AgentXNode.next(SubRequest request) causes worker
  thread to use max CPU kernel when a GETBULK PDU is processed that has no repeaters.

[2014-05-12] v2.2.0
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.2.0 SNMP4J v2.3.0 or later)

* Improved: Generics support (removed unchecked warnings).
* Added: BufferedMOTableModel and BufferMOMutableTableModel for efficiently
  implementing large virtual SNMP tables.

[2014-02-14] v2.1.3
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.1.1 SNMP4J v2.2.5 or later)

* Fixed [SFJ-87]: The engine ID applied to the AgentXMasterAgent constructors
  was not set/used in the class itself (although it was used in the super class
  and thus in all SNMP4J-Agent contexts. Nevertheless, the SNMP4J-AgentX
  master agent example reported a wrong engine ID in its community MIB.

[2014-02-11] v2.1.2
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.1.1 SNMP4J v2.2.5 or later)

* Updated: SNMP4J to 2.2.5 and SNMP4J-Agent to 2.1.1 to fix a serious bug
  in the AgentXCommandProcessor that could cause AgentX sub-requests to be
  dropped before they are answered.
  This bug was a regression in SNMP4J-Agent 2.0 and was fixed by
  SNMP4J-Agent 2.1.1.

[2014-01-07] v2.1.1
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.1.0 SNMP4J v2.2.3 or later)

* Updated: License agreement.
* Fixed: Release operation for index allocation.
* Fixed: Added missing maven-plugin versions in pom.xml. Fixed repo URLs.
* Fixed: Possibility of NPE in AgentXCommandProcessor.addRegion(..).
* Fixed: [SFJ-65] AgentXSharedMOTableSupport not used/overwritten.
* Fixed: [SFJ-46] SysOREntry was not initialized in master agent with subagent
  data because of an incorrect ManagedObject search scope.

[2012-04-03] v2.1.0
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.0.6 and SNMP4J 2.1.0)

* Improved: [SJF-58] Shared table index allocation support.
* Added: Relevant SNMP4J-AgentX MIBs.

(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.0.4 and SNMP4J 2.0.2)

* Fixed [SFJ-50]: SysUpTimeImpl returns 1.000.000 times to high value
  (regression in SNMP4J-AGENT 2.0.0).
  Improved [SFJ-49]: TTLSTM and DefaultTcoTransportMapping on AIX did
  caught in an endless loop because select() there returns a spurious
  read indication while write data is pending in fact.

[2011-09-01] v2.0.3
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.0.3 and SNMP4J 2.0.1)

* Fixed [SFJ-48]: Inconsistent register/unregister behavior of MODefaultServer when
  using zero length OctetString as context for register and unregister operation.
  This was a regression in version 2.0.0.

[2011-09-01] v2.0.2
(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.0.2 and SNMP4J 2.0.1)

(Requires SNMP4J-Agent 2.0.0 and SNMP4J 2.0.1)

* Fixed: [SFJ-44] NullPointerException in master agent when starting
  agent.

  AgentX PDU which violates RFC 2741.
* Fixed: [SFJ-24] High CPU usage in DefaultTcpTransportMapping
  with some JREs (especially Java 1.5 but also some 1.6).
* Fixed: [SFJ-26] SubAgentX.closeSession(..) does not sent
  correct session ID to master agent. Instead 0 is sent.

* Initial release: Use at your own risk! There are many
  untested areas in the code. Most JavaDoc is missing
  although the code should be fairly complete. All AgentX
  features should be supported, including shared table,
  context, and full GETBULK support.
  The API supports master and sub-agents using TCP
  connections.
